    <h1> The History of Html By David Buicke </h1>
    <br>
    

    <hr> <h1 style="background-color: beige;">The Start:</h1>
    <p style="background-color: lawngreen;">HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 but was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. Another version called 4.0 was later published in 1999. HTML is a constant evolving language with updated versions coming out every so often, to make website building more easier and better looking for people who want to make web pages. </p>

    <hr> <h1 style="background-color: lightpink;">Version 1.0 & 2.0:</h1>
    <p style="background-color: oldlace;">The first version of the HTML was to allow people to share info and make it accessible to people by a web browser. This showed that the language was not evolving because the people developing it were not creating the websites themselves. Later in 1995 came the 2.0 version that had all the previous features of the 1.0 version with new features which became the standard for makeup language until 1997 which reanalyzed the features of HTML. </p>

    <br>

    <hr> <h1 style="background-color: orchid;">Version 3.0 & 4.0:</h1>
    <p style="background-color:greenyellow;">Afterwards came the 3.0 version of HTML where Dave Ragget inserted a fresh draft on to HTML. It made new features for HTML, more powerful characteristics to people designing the webpage. These improvements also came with problems that slowed down the browser when applying more features. 

        Later the 4.01 version came out and was wildly used before the 5.0 version of HTML which is used worldwide. The HTML 5.0 version is said to be an extension of the 4.01 version which was published in 2012. </p>

    <br>

    <hr> <h1 style="background-color:hotpink">XHTML:</h1>
    <p style="background-color: cornsilk;">There is also XHTML 1.0 which stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, where it is a joint standard with 4.01 version, it is a new branch of HTML which incorporate XML, so people must write the code properly. It also allows more assesability and functionality, it is a new set of coding rules. It is stricter, better looking and more fruitful version of HTML. </p>
    <hr>
    <br>

    <hr> <h1 style="background-color: lightblue;">Future of HTML:</h1>
    <p style="background-color: mediumspringgreen;">Over the course of HTMLâ€™s development, it has progressed significantly over time since Sir Tim Berners-Lee developed HTML. It will keep changing in the future which will offer more functionality for webpages which will provide more adaptability for the web designer making the user have a better time when they are visiting a website. It will also focus more on its purpose that it was designed for which was to have a consistent organization of a webpage. With HTML known worldwide there can be distinctive characteristics set for different languages to attract more people to this coding language.  </p>

    <br>

    <hr> <h1 style="background-color: powderblue;">Conclusion:</h1>
    <p style="background-color: darkgoldenrod;">When the internet was starting out there were a lot less functional web pages. Now with technology becoming more redefining as time goes by web developers must make sure the web pages, they develop are right in a way that they are on laptops or cell phones and other technological devices. HTML is interactive and so consumers will demand more features and will have more developers wanting to make the language grow more.  </p>
